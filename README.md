# RAG_scientific_paper
Create a RAG that has memory and can give us insight based on scientific paper used in training

# Intro

there are some pre requisites for playing around with RAGs locally. 
1. First is downloading one LLM ( I installed Ollama)
2. ( Optional) Then if we want our model to have memory, we also need to install and setup Postgres ( or another database)
3. Install packages you see in requirements.txt
4. Code =)
